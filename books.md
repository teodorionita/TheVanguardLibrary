### The Search for Modern China
*by Jonathan D. Spence*

Chinese history from the end of the Ming to the present. Strong on intellectual history for a general-purpose work. My favorite history textbook. Some Chinese scholars number Spence among the Three Capable Individuals of Sinology, along with Frederic Wakeman and Philip Kuhn. Personally, I consider him among the Few Textbook Writers Who Write Quite Well.

### On War (Vom Kriege)
*by Carl von Clausewitz*

Very delightful in several ways. Firstly, interesting re the topic of war. Secondly, I love his style of thinking. Third, some of his strategic insights apply to other domains.

To me Clausewitz is a quintessential 19th century Rationalist. These are useful to know about because one can get a sense of what a rationalist is when they have nothing to do with LessWrong. A remarkable amount of this book has to do with Clausewitz's theories of the various virtues that redound to success in war, and he devises almost alchemical formulae for boldness, perseverance, the use of the will to apply reason to courage, etc.

Clausewitz sometimes sounds like a samurai poet. Of the skilled grand strategist, he tells us: "It is the exact fulfilment of silent suppositions, it is the noiseless harmony of the whole action which we should admire, and which only makes itself known in the total result." I find his writing unexpectedly phenomenological and experiential, which would seem at odds with its rationalistic character but is somehow only enhanced by it. 

I particularly enjoy the Ukemi Audiobooks version narrated by Martyn Swain. "This Ukemi recording opens with the introduction by Louise Wilmot, lecturer in history, Open University, and continues with the preface by Marie von Clausewitz (read by Sarah Sherborne)." The introduction and preface are worth reading in their own right.

If you listen on audiobook be careful of zoning out. This one can be dense, and I have bounced off of it before, years ago. I sometimes get into a groove where I'm picking everything up, and sometimes I let it pass by in a more breezy way. I won't let this note devolve into general recommendations on audiobook listening but I'll just say this is one that may be worth going through a few times. I like to get a gem from Clausewitz and then spend some time thinking it through.
