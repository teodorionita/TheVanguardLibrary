### The Search for Modern China
*by Jonathan D. Spence*

Chinese history from the end of the Ming to the present. Strong on intellectual history for a general-purpose work. My favorite history textbook. Some Chinese scholars number Spence among the Three Capable Individuals of Sinology, along with Frederic Wakeman and Philip Kuhn. Personally, I consider him among the Few Textbook Writers Who Write Quite Well.
